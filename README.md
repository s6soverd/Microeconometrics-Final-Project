This repository contains my replication of results from Pop-Eleches, Cristian, and Miguel Urquiola (2013). "Going to a Better School: Effects and Behavioral Responses." 
*American Economic Review*, 103 (4): 1289-1324. The original paper, including the data sets, and the codes by the authors can be accessed [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.4.1289).


### Brief Description of the paper:


Pop-Eleches et al. (2013) examines the effect of going to a better school on student outcomes and on behavioral responses that amplify or reduce the quality of educational quality. They apply **regression discontinuity design** to the Romanian secondary school system, producing two findings. First, students who gain access to higher achievement schools perform better in a graduation test. Secondly, the opportunity to attend quality-wise better schools result in significant behavioral responses, particularly: *(i)* Teachers sort in a manner consistent with a preference for higher achieving students, *(ii)* Children who get into better schools realize they are relatively weaker and feel marginalized; *(iii)* Parents reduce their effort when their children attend a better school. \
In this project, I replicate the results from Pop-Eleches et al. (2013) and look into the causal relationship between attending a higher-ranked school and student outcomes, and 
behavioral responses it triggers. 


### On a Side Note

The replication is conducted using Python, I have stored my functions that generate tables and figures in seperate files, which you can access
[here](https://github.com/s6soverd/Microeconometrics-Final-Project/blob/master/auxiliary/project_auxiliary_tables.py),and
[here](https://github.com/s6soverd/Microeconometrics-Final-Project/blob/master/auxiliary/project_auxiliary_plots.py),
